{"body":"# Ser.ve\r\n\r\nSer.ve is the simplest way to get your servers up and running\r\nwith the applications you want.\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\n\r\nFirst, pick a few packages you'd like to install and pipe them to \r\nyour shell. Like so:\r\n\r\n```terminal\r\nsh <(curl -L ser.ve) ruby mongodb nginx\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it. Your server will be ready to go.\r\n\r\n### Package Listings\r\n\r\nHere are the current packages that are avaliable to install and use.\r\nAny marked as *Latest* will grab the latest version via your package manager.\r\n\r\n- Ruby (1.9.3-p327)\r\n- JRuby (1.7.1)\r\n- NodeJS (v0.8.16)\r\n- MongoDB (2.2.2)\r\n- MySQL (Lastest)\r\n- Nginx (Lastest)\r\n- Postgresql (Lastest)\r\n- Redis (Lastest)\r\n\r\n### Custom Installation\r\n\r\nHere are some common server setups. To customize your server setup just\r\nappend or remove the name of package as an argument.\r\n\r\n##### Ruby MySQL Apache\r\n\r\n```terminal\r\nsh <(curl -L ser.ve) ruby mysql apache\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### NodeJS MongoDB Nginx\r\n\r\n```terminal\r\nsh <(curl -L ser.ve) nodejs mongodb nginx\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### JRuby Redis PostgreSQL Nginx\r\n\r\n```terminal\r\nsh <(curl -L ser.ve) jruby redis posgresql nginx\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nThis application was designed for use with 64-Bit CentOS, RHEL, and Fedora.\r\n\r\n### Final Notes\r\n\r\nCommon build tools such as Make and GCC as well as Git, and screen will be installed by default.\r\nTo circumvent this use the `-common` argument. Feedback, pushes, and forks are welcome. :octocat:\r\n\r\n### License\r\nMIT &copy; 2012 Nick Barth\r\n","name":"Ser.ve","tagline":"Server Setups Made Simple","note":"Don't delete this file!
